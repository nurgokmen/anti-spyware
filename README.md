# Anti-Spyware Program

This project is an **anti-spyware program** written in Python. It is designed to help identify and monitor suspicious activities related to spyware, such as monitoring files, processes, and network activity.

## Features

The anti-spyware program includes the following features:

1. **Scan Files**: Allows you to scan files in a specified directory for potential spyware.
2. **Monitor Processes**: Monitors running processes to detect suspicious activities related to spyware.
3. **Monitor Network Activity**: Monitors network activity to identify any unusual connections or data transfers.
4. **Simulate Spyware (Safe)**: Simulates a benign form of spyware to test the functionality of the program in a safe environment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `psutil` library for monitoring processes
- `scapy` library for network activity monitoring (if included)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install psutil scapy
```

# How to Use

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anti-spyware.git

```
Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd anti-spyware
```
Run the program:
```
python main.py
```
The program will display a menu with options to:

- Scan files in a directory
- Monitor system processes
- Monitor network activity
- Simulate spyware (safe)
- Exit the program
  
Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired functionality.

# How It Works

**_File Scanning_** :
The program scans a specified directory for files that may potentially be spyware. It uses basic file heuristics and signatures to identify suspicious files.

**_Process Monitoring_**:
The program monitors the processes running on the system. It looks for processes with suspicious names or behaviors (e.g., excessive memory usage, specific names).

**_Network Activity Monitoring_**:
The program captures and analyzes network traffic to detect unusual connections or data transfers that could be indicative of spyware communication.

**_Safe Spyware Simulation_**:
This feature simulates the behavior of spyware for testing purposes. It helps validate the effectiveness of the program in detecting and responding to spyware-like behavior without introducing any real danger.
